# RL--Q-learning-and-SARSA
Algorithmic Implementation of Q-Learning and SARSA for Price Optimization

The objective of this project is to use Q-learning and SARSA to learn price optimization.
The algorithm with the highest rewards is selected. In this case it was Q-learning, an off-policy algorithm.
